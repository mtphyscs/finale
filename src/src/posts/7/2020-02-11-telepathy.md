Telepathy is the direct transmission of information through the use of the mind only, without the use of the five senses. This transmission can be carried out intentionally or not, from a transmitter to a receiver, even if it is separated by a great distance.

Information can be received in many ways, such as broken sentences or words suddenly popping up in the mind, quick or incomplete images , uncommon lucid dreams, or just sudden concern for a person we may not have heard for some time.

Sharing information, emotions and feelings, without using the five senses ... To speak of this incredible possibility, we use a term that derives from the Greek téle (far) and pàthos (suffering) . 
The etymology, however, is misleading. In fact, telepathy is basically a paranormal relationship between two or more people. But as far as “ remote suffering ” is concerned, it would be part of a kind of mental suggestion, which concerns more the magical field than the parapsychological one . 

Actually, telesthesia would be the most suitable term: téle (far) and àisthèsis (sensation) . However, especially in the last century, it was used as a synonym for clairvoyance (that is, for the direct extrasensory perception of objects and events in circumstances such as to exclude telepathy). 
Many examples of spontaneous telepathy arise during sleep . But even in the waking condition, so-called telepathic hallucinations or, less notably, telepathic intuitions are relatively frequent.
What is called a spontaneous case is a paranormal event that involves suddenly and unexpectedly. We can be particularly receptive people and therefore subject to frequent paranormal experiences, or there can only be one case in life.

In addressing the subject of telepathy, it is also necessary to dwell, albeit briefly , on a very similar phenomenon: clairvoyance , that is, the direct paranormal acquisition of information. 
For example, guessing a series of cards shuffled automatically by a machine and not observed by anyone. However, apart from some cases (and especially in the laboratory), it is not possible to clearly distinguish telepathy from clairvoyance , because most of the time it is not possible to know if the information acquired paranormally is already known by some living person . 
To distinguish telepathy from clairvoyance, the following definitions have been proposed:
Telepathy is an extrasensory perception in which the source of information is made up of another (living) person.

Clairvoyance is an extrasensory perception in which the source of information is represented by a physical object or an objective situation.
It could also be hypothesized that telepathy, clairvoyance, retro and precognition are different manifestations in the expressive form , but not in the substance, of a single psi "cognitive" phenomenon, which transcends the limits of space and time. .
##Practical experiments for everyone.


In the study of paranormal phenomena , verification in the first person always represents great satisfaction. There are many experiments that can be carried out to discover the reality of telepathy.
Although there is obviously a foolproof method of obtaining a telepathic transmission , there are more or less talented people, and you too may have good paranormal abilities , without knowing it. . Therefore, I will try to expose some simple methods and exercises to verify these skills.
We will start with three preliminary techniques: breathing, concentration, visualization . My advice, then, can only be a suggestion, a starting point: you will be the one to discover the method with which you will obtain the most positive results and recognize the most appropriate experimentation, between the transmission of drawings, images, words, sensations ...

Furthermore, perceptions take on different characteristics depending on the perceiver: there are those who have visions, those who hear words, those who receive confusing and difficult “ decoding ” stimuli .
To obtain good results, numerous attempts, a lot of practice and above all the patience are required to study in depth his internal reactions : knowing how to read in ourselves the signs that represent the answer.
The famous psychic Eileen Garrett , when she wanted to establish telepathic contact, started with deep, rhythmic breathing. The rhythm given to the breath, in the words of the aforementioned Irish psychic, would have the purpose of facilitating the connection with " creative consciousness ". . Yoga also attaches great importance to the respiratory rhythm, and then rises to metaphysical concepts. 
Returning to telepathy, the application of these practices is based on the alternation of long pauses (in which the breath is maintained) between inspiration and exhalation , of the means distributed as follows:
inspiration: ten second pause: five seconds exhalation: ten second pause: five seconds
The times can be changed as desired: it is sufficient that the breaks correspond exactly to half of the other phases. Additionally, respiration can be measured relative to your heart rate ( inspiration: 10 beats; pause: 5 beats; etc. ).


It seems that better results are achieved by lengthening the time . An occult oral tradition also states that two people will get a good telepathic dialogue by synchronizing their breathing. The deep inhalation phase of one should correspond to the exhalation phase of the other. 
However, some tannic yoga schools teach how the breathing rhythm of the two people should proceed in unison . Breathing, therefore, is revealed as the first simple " preliminary technique ".
Concentration is also important. But there are those who say that it is by no means indispensable, referring to cases of spontaneous telepathy . I totally agree that the lack of concentration is total in the involuntary flashes; even, in certain cases, the vigilant consciousness itself is altered or absent (as in dreams). 

Another thing, however, are the experiments in which the establishment of a telepathic relationship is established a priori, that is, when one consciously chooses to transmit or perceive . 
"The kind of concentration I am indicating is to focus your attention on a single theme or a simple thought, such as joy or peace, and to keep it permanently. This does not mean thinking; rather, it is a way of inhibiting thoughts , with the exception of a single thought and a single object of thought. 
It must also inhibit the urge to think about, examine, evaluate, or allow memories connected to it.  Most people have never heard of this type of concentration and therefore need to learn how to do it. At the same time, you must learn to relax ... »

Once you have reached a good state of relaxation, you can continue with the visualization technique . It consists of thinking intensely, closing the eyes, of the person who will have to perceive the telepathic message, trying to " materialize " it in front of him. 
At first you can get, at best, a rather confusing picture . Then, with the help of memory, you will have to make the figure more different: begin to outline the eyes, nose, mouth, etc., until the portrait of the person is clearly formed. 

When the image becomes clear and stable, it is time to think persistently about the communication that will take place by representing it written before your eyes . According to Oliva and Morelli, who describe this technique in a vintage book, the method would work: it is enough, they say, to have just a little patience.
Let's turn to the presentation of a first experiment: the transmission of drawings . I suggest practicing in pairs, but you can still expand the number of participants you want. A person (agent) draws a drawing. 
In the beginning, very simple or symbolic representations will be preferred , therefore gradually more complex. Another person (perceiver) will be placed in another room or, if this is not possible, in the same room, using the appropriate precautions (bulkheads and others) to avoid " sensory leaks " (which consist of perceiving through the senses).

Any number of designs will be shipped. Before starting the experiment, the precise moment of drawing the drawings and the time available to " receive " them (for example, ten minutes) will be established.
At the end of a series, the documents will be compared: it is preferable that this operation be carried out by a third person, defined as blind (that is, without realizing the experiment). Such a person will have to find analogies, compare all the figures, and then combine them one by one.

The optimal result is obtained when the so-called blind man, ignoring the exact sequence of the drawings, combines them based on similar details between those transmitted and those received telepathically.
American psychic Edgar Cayce suggests a slightly more complex practice. He advises setting some specific times of the day. The person to be placed as the recipient in the subsequent telepathic experiment will have to take note of what the other subject (the future agent) is doing at those specific times. 
These observations should be repeated for many days and then compared. Correspondence must originate with this system, a kind of habit of guiding one's thoughts on the companion of future experimentation. 
During actual telepathic transmission, both people (agent and perceiver) must focus exclusively on what they are trying to accomplish. Traced the drawing, During all the pre-established time , the agent must observe the drawn figure, with the intention of transmitting it. 

The other person, on the other hand, will have to free his mind from all thoughts and worries in order to achieve an adequate telepathic connection.
