      <h1>Who Am I</h1>

      <p>
        I’m a creative thinker and maker–of–software based in Miami Beach,
        Florida; born+raised in Costa Rica. I’m passionate about the
        intersection of art, technology, design, and philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm interested in emerging technology, design systems, and creating
        memorable experiences that push the boundaries of our times. I’m a
        multi-disciplinary designer, developer and dabbler of all creative
        matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm powerful enough to live in accordance with my own values, desire,
        and truths. I'm an alchemist devoted to uncovering the gems that are
        already here. A polymath that loves detail and being able to go wherever
        my interests decide. I'm ever-expanding yet whole; wise enough to know
        that there is plenty left to learn; humble and happy as I grow. I'm
        grateful for who I am and can be.

      <h1>What Is mtphyscs</h1>
      <p>
        mtphyscs is an abstract idea that was created to make tangible what is
        inside of my mind and soul. mtphyscs is a theory with no basis in
        reality that deals with concepts such as being, knowing, substance,
        cause, identity, time, and space.
