      <h1>What Is mtphyscs</h1>
      <p>
        mtphyscs comes from the word "metaphysics", a branch of philosophy that
        examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship
        between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between
        potentiality and actuality. mtphyscs is an abstract idea that was
        created to make tangible what comes to the mind from the higher planes
        of existence. mtphyscs is a theory with no basis in reality that deals
        with concepts such as being, knowing, substance, existence, time and
        space, cause and effect, and possibility. mtphyscs aims to inspire
        through manifestations in multiple mediums, channels, forms, and through
        the continued curation of its digital platform.

        technology, design, and philosophy.

        I'm interested in emerging technology, design systems, and creating

        I'm powerful enough to live in accordance with my own values, desire,

        already here. A polymath that loves detail and being able to go wherever
        my interests decide. I'm ever-expanding yet whole; wise enough to know
        that there is plenty left to learn; humble and happy as I grow. I'm
        grateful for who I am and can be.
