We are working on the concept of motivation in action , especially in achieving our goals. This action relates us to others even unconsciously.
Apparently an act always has the same consequences, if it is done in similar situations. However, there are aspects that are not seen, but that are present in the action. This time we mean intention.
An act that benefits someone can be done wickedly or with kindness . Outwardly these two acts may be the same. But the consequences for all actors are different.
Who wants to hurt, hurts himself. The damage is of a moral nature. That person consciously enters a dark world. He who wants to do well, even when he does not achieve his goal, is developing morally.
By this we mean that actions are not defined only by achievement in material terms. There are also spiritual achievements that correspond to character development.
##Different Intentions

One of the most important aspects of action is intention. Perhaps it is the most complicated to understand since it refers to values, ethics and the same action can have very different intentions.
We all have experiences of people who when we are in need offer us help, but we feel that their intention is not healthy and we prefer to continue with the problem and look for another solution, rather than accept that help.
The issue is complex since once the favor is received we are in debt. This is one of the reasons why politicians are adept at hiding their personal interests under the guise of aid to the city or the country.
A wealthy person can give important contributions to solve problems in the city, but he gives it knowing that this will pay him a lot of benefits, such as getting people to vote for politicians related to him.
But in reality what matters is not so much what others do and their intentions, but what we do.
##Will and Intention 

Let's start by saying that there is an energy that drives us to act. Schopenhauer calls it the Will. That energy can be shown as sexual drive, hunger, the need to protect ourselves against inclement weather, the need for sleep. These basic desires can take different forms, but they are usually unconscious.
We respond to these needs by giving them meaning, direction.
That direction that we give to our desires most of the time is learned and even imposed by the media that tell us how we should satisfy our needs, of course depending on their interests.
But we can also give them a conscious sense. However, with intention there is a new phenomenon. It is related to our consciousness. This is why we say that it has to do with our ethical development.

##The Emotion

Here we have introduced the word "emotional" on purpose.
Achieving goals is often viewed as intellectual work . That the whole process is rational, but in reality our desires arise from subconsciousness. Only later do we make them rational, when we make plans.
However, intention has a lot to do with emotions. We can say that the heart is the one that directs the emotions and tells us much of what the reason does not know.
This means that if we want to have good intentions we must educate our emotions and this is achieved through art. Attending works of art like music or museums and learning some artistic skill.
There is something else in the development of our emotions and it refers to understanding others . Understand that just as our body is made of the same elements as planet earth or any other planet. 
Our emotions are made of the same elements that are made of the same elements that live in other human beings. In other words, what we feel is also felt by others.
##Intellectual and Artists

Many times we have met artists who distrust intellectuals and vice versa, intellectuals who despise artists. We have to make an effort not to fall into these extremes. If we want our motives to be noble we have to be prepared to reflect on them and to educate our emotions.
As can be inferred from the above, we are recognizing Schopenhauer's contributions on this topic. He not only adds to the western development of intellect, the emotional aspect. The importance of the Will that he indicates as prior to thought.
First we want and then we sit down to think how to channel those wishes. In this reflection we discover that it is necessary that our emotions do not manifest themselves in an uncontrolled way, but that we have to educate them.
Motivation refers to the energy that drives us to achieve our goals. However, this is not an automatic process. It is not enough to achieve our objectives, it is very important to understand with what intention we achieved them.
The intention is closely related to our emotional and ethical development . It is really the key to tell us if we are developing our character. Understanding our intentions is a way to get to know us better.
