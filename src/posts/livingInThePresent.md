Living in the present is perhaps one of the most frequently found tips in the personal and spiritual growth literature . I have always wondered how to put into practice that recommendation that seemed so simple in its description, but so complex in its execution, because for ordinary human beings it is not easy for us to escape the ramblings of the mind about what has been lived in the past. and what we hope to experience in the future. 

Thinking about how to put this recommendation into practice on a day-to-day basis, I have realized that everything that happens in our lives is connected in a continuous way in time and that the separation between one event and another is nothing more than a subterfuge of the mind to be able to process and understand them.

If we choose and analyze any event, we will find that before and after its occurrence there are other events that we call causes and effects or consequences, with which it unfailingly connects and that this connection may be very near or far in time and / or in space, depending on each particular situation.

It is difficult to imagine that something happens without at least one cause that generates it . Some consider that the only causeless event could be the beginning of creation, which would be the singularity contemplated by the Big Bang theorists or the existence of the Creator himself, who would be the first cause of everything that happened later, the first Aristotelian immobile engine that set the mechanism of creation in motion. Similarly, the existence of events without any consequence is unlikely and for practical purposes it is as if those events had never existed. In that sense, perhaps non-believers in the existence of a God think that at least the beginning of creation was a causeless event and that its end will have no effect, but it is possible that the answer to that doubt is precisely that both events are part of that endless continuum whose connection we do not yet understand.

In the daily work it is important to understand that everything that happens has its origins in causes that are in the past and on which we can no longer act , so it is useless to suffer and be mortified by what has already happened and by its bad consequences or feel nostalgic for those good things from the past that are no longer there. The most we can do is learn from the consequences that our actions generate to avoid repeating those that we do not want and to promote those that we like to do so. On the other hand, it is also necessary to understand that what will happen in the future will be the consequences of what we do today and on that if we can have control .

Understanding how causes and consequences are related in time confirms the importance of the present as a consequence of the past and cause of the future . Therefore, it is important to be clear that the present is the only time in which we can live , because the past is no longer there and the future has not yet arrived. The past and the future only exist in our minds , the present is the only available temporal space in which we can act. But, if we ask ourselves , how long does the present last? In a strict sense, we could say that "nothing" lasts, only the instant that serves as a transition between the past and the future. However, that moment is repeated over and over again generating a continuum in which the past is always left behind and the future becomes the present. Therefore, our only option to live in the present is to do it in each of those moments when the past is gone and the future has not yet arrived . But how can we achieve that? That is the great question to which we must find an answer.

Science has tried to determine objectively how long that instant we call present or now lasts and in that sense it has devised experiments whose results can help us understand how to achieve that goal of living in the present. Among the interesting results that we can mention from these experiments are the following:

It seems that we are not able to be aware of any stimulus whose duration is less than 500 milliseconds, although unconsciously if we perceive it . In other words, our awareness of now does not include events lasting less than ½ second.

It takes between 10 to 15 seconds to understand or be aware of the changes that occur in our environment . According to this, it seems that our present consciousness lasts between 10 and 15 seconds. This would also imply that we never really managed to live in the present but in the past of our last 10 to 15 seconds , that this period is our true now.

The avalanche of stimuli to which we are exposed forces our consciousness to integrate them in that instant that we call “now” , as a coherent reality that is what we finally become aware of. Which means that in that integration we could “get lost” or not be aware of some events that occur around us.

According to the theory of Relativity , time does not flow at the same speed for all beings capable of perceiving it . It flows slower as the speed of the sensor is higher with respect to the same reference point. This would imply that the perception that he is now the same for everyone is not real, it is an illusion.
Time is not "something" that we can perceive in itself, what we perceive are its effects and that makes us conclude that there is "something" that generates those effects which we call time.
Other experiments have concluded that our "psychological present" or "feeling of the now" lasts around three seconds , it seems that in this period it is that we become aware of our emotional state.

One of the most interesting results is that our brain prepares to execute the actions that we consider voluntary, between 300 and 500 milliseconds before we execute them , which could be interpreted as our brain knowing before ourselves (our consciousness) that we want to take action, which would imply that he makes decisions before we are aware of them.

What these conclusions do is corroborate the short time we have to live in the present. However, since our future constantly becomes the now , what we actually experience is a series of instants in a continuous present. In this sense, given that we can no longer act on the causes of what happens in our lives, we can only make sure that the effects of our actions at each moment generate a future worth living; a future to do good, without harming anyone. Whoever lives in this way will do so in an eternal present, whose past will only serve as a reference for not repeating actions that generate bad effects and if repeating those that build a future with better results, which in turn become causes of better consequences.
