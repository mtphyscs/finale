We continue to work on the concept of motivation as an internal force that drives us to be creators.

On this occasion we are going to reflect on the meaning of life . Although many people think that it is not necessary to make sense of things, that it is enough to live daily, with the pleasures or difficulties typical of existence. Other people try to find out what is the meaning of life. Many start by asking others. They consider that the answer has some authority. This search also includes looking for the answer within oneself. This is the attempt we are going to make here.

##Life's sense

Many people live daily. The main thing is to eat, sleep and do the activities that life is imposing on them. They study because it is a requirement and because that gives them meaning or they work for the same reason. But they don't wonder what the meaning of their life is. His goals are those that society gives him through his family, friends and the media. However, other people wonder not only about their medium-term goals, but whether life has any meaning. This is a requirement that the Greek Philosophers already proposed. The statement "know thyself" refers to this.

##The philosophical meaning of life

Some philosophers like Kant have tried to escape this problem by pointing out that the essence cannot be known, even if it exists. Kant affirmed that behind what we perceive is "the thing itself". But that this "thing in itself" cannot be known.

This idea is contrary to that of Plato, who referred to the "cave myth . "

He meant that a group of human beings lived in a cave where light barely entered. They only perceived shadows and considered that to be the reality. Until one of them dared to leave the cavern. At first he was dazzled, but then he got used to the light and began to perceive illuminated objects. He returned to the cave to share his discovery with the others, but they called him crazy. 

This is a problem that always repeats itself. Whoever discovers something new and participates, is always branded as crazy . Only with time others dare to repeat the experiment and discover that it is real. Schopenhauer tells us that Kant did not dare to say that this essence of things can be known. Schopenhauer tells us that it is the Will. That force that we feel within us that always wants. In reality all things have Will. All things want. Even that seemingly senseless moving insect.

##Will and Sense

So to get to know one of the questions we must ask ourselves is what do I want? It seems like a simple question, but it is very difficult to answer. One of the problems is that society has taught us what we should want. So the first answers we give refer to what we think we should want.

But there is another problem . We are going to discover that there are many stimuli for us to make the elections expected by those who have created those stimuli. We want what is in fashion. But there are many fashionable things and then we are unhappy because we cannot have everything. Although we achieve what is sold to us as the most advanced, soon they are selling us something superior. We are always unsatisfied. There are those who propose to stop loving and separate from the world. But if we did, we will continue to want. And we ask ourselves again what do I want?

##Intention and meaning

A first answer is I want to learn. But each one has to discover in what he wants to gain experience. We also have to ask ourselves if this is a goal that contains steps and that we must achieve those steps in a certain order. If we want to learn languages, we have to ask ourselves which language we are going to start with. Once we choose the language, we have to understand that we have to start with the basics and ask ourselves if we are willing to continue learning it throughout our lives. Even our own language, we never fully learn it.

Another aspect of understanding the meaning of life is discovering that our interpretations of life have been given to us by others. They have been given to us by our parents, religious representatives, teachers, scientists. The problem is that we have accepted a lot of this knowledge without testing it.

##Learn to think

We believe what our parents, our priests, our teachers or our scientists have told us. But believing is not knowing. There is even a contradiction between what some say and what others say. Faced with this we discover something else: we have to learn to think. So to make sense of life we ​​have to learn. Much of that learning comes from other people. But we have to learn to discern from all that they teach us that it is true and that it is false.

Above all, we have to discover what is useful for us. We cannot make our life following the path that others want to point out to us. If we consider that they have learned to think and make choices, we have to discover that we have that capacity that we grant to others. That link they have with life, we also have, although we have not awakened it.

##We are creators of meaning

By having a goal and working on it, we discover our strengths and weaknesses. It is not that we are going to dedicate ourselves only to this activity. Life offers us many responsibilities and we must fulfill them. But we must also give space to that goal that is ours. If we continue along this line, we will gradually improve and we will become experts in that. Perhaps it is an area that no one cares about more, or at least we think so. But we are creating a path that is only ours.

Then we will discover that we are creators. That it is not only that life has meaning, but that we give meaning to life. We discovered that we have the right to interpret life, from our perspective. Furthermore, we discovered that no one else can have our perspective and that when we offer our point of view, there are people who are amazed because they are learning something from us. This is great wealth. We understand that by having dared to create our own path, we can offer our knowledge A knowledge that is only seen from our point of view. Then we will discover that we interpret differently not because we are wrong, but because we have reached a summit that others were unaware of.
