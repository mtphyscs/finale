Each human being has personal responsibility from the day they are born. To a certain extent, even small children can be held responsible – in all areas that they can independently oversee, evaluate and answer for.

There is not a person on God’s earth that is not responsible for their own deeds, in one way or another. Therefore it is inappropriate to pass responsibility on to others, because the day comes when everyone is confronted with that which they don’t want to be responsible for.

In light of this, become aware of the power you unleash once you consciously accept responsibility. Make no excuses, don’t talk anything down, and perceive what is. Take responsibility for everything that comes into this world from and through you.

True inner strength is gained by working consciously with the energy of responsibility. Inner strength grows to the extent that a person acts with personal responsibility. However, one’s strength and self-confidence is diminished when a person – out of fear or even out of convenience – delegates responsibility that is theirs.
