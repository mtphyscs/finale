“There are only two days in the year when nothing can be done. One is called yesterday and the other one tomorrow. Therefore, today is the ideal day to love, believe, do and mainly, live. ” - Dalai Lama

We have heard a lot about the importance of living in the present . However, the here and now is an abstract concept. And generally, every abstract concept comes with the possibility of not being understood correctly.

The Carpe Diem is perhaps one of the most used and poorly focused concepts, due to the ambiguity of its content.

So, in order not to make mistakes, we are going to propose a concept for living here and now that enables us to evolve and grow spiritually.

Living here and now has to do with being present , experiencing the moment you are going through. It does not depend on the moment , but on us and our ability so that whatever the event of the present moment is composed, we can experience it conscientiously to get the most out of it . So, living the here and now does not have to do with an urge to modify the moment capriciously and do whatever we want without thinking of consequences. This is an empty and flat interpretation, totally superficial and it lends itself to not being able to identify the process that is really taking place within us.

Here we are going to talk about a slightly deeper sense of this, and which in turn is necessary to reach a state of fullness and tranquility . Something that can help us cope with our lives in a more enriching way.

Most of us (and I am leaving a margin here, because people never cease to amaze me) are in a vital search for simple and continuous happiness . Hand in hand with that happiness, we can be present in the here and now, and live each moment consciously .

But as human beings, we have a number of needs that must be met as a prerequisite before reaching this happiness. These needs are to have something to eat, water, to have a place to rest, etc. Once these primary conditions are satisfied, we should be ready to focus on the here and now.

However, it is not enough. We always want more .

In fact, we have an incredible ability to adapt to what we already have, and our thirst now leads us to look for something else. We live coiled in a spiral of longings that never ends, because it is not in our nature to reach a complete state of satiety .

Of course you will celebrate that new job, that new house or car that you have wanted so much, but that " happiness " never lasts too long. It disappears as quickly as it was generated to give way again to a search state.

Well, an interesting fact is that this psychological process has a name. It is called Hedonic Adaptation , and it is what makes that thing that we so desired come to bore us at some point after achieving it.

This adaptation is part of our nature and if we are not aware of it, it constantly prevents us from living in the present.

Well, now we already know. However, that is only the beginning to start living the present.

This happiness that we seek many times is determined by something in particular that has to happen sometime later . Some event, thing or person in the future will bring us happiness in our lives and will allow us to enjoy every moment, to live the present in fullness. And so, we live with our sights set on that which never comes , and if it does come, thanks to the hedonic adaptation it becomes something everyday and the object of our happiness becomes something else.

Meanwhile, in the present events are happening one after another without waiting for you to stop to observe them. They sneak like sand between your fingers and get lost .

Furthermore, we have the ability to bring the focus of our attention to certain events that have occurred in the past and constantly bring them to our head . Traumatic situations, bad decisions, or negative things that have happened to us only by chance are remembered and victimized. Intentionally or unintentionally, we get rid of the responsibility to experience what today has for us , and to take an attitude about it that builds our lives. For those caught up in past events, we will be able to learn a lot from the 4 Hindu laws of spirituality .

The here and now is constantly evolving, all the time. It is flowing right now . And regretting the past or living unsatisfied going from one desired future to another they take away from us.

In a practical way, living here and now is completely achievable, fortunately. But it requires the constitution of certain habits that must be carried out every day. And as you practice them, you will notice the difference.

This is essential. If the first five minutes of the day you take the time to write down the things for which you are grateful , your brain will get used to looking for those things, however small, that make you happy and bring them to your mind. Even if you feel like there is nothing good in your life right now, make the effort. As you practice this, it will be less and less difficult to find these reasons for happiness.

It is also good that you not only repeat them in your mind, but write them down on paper. The brain has the capacity to store what it reads for longer than a thought that only intersects.

Your time is your true capital. Take advantage of it .

Work what you have to work and dedicate time to your life and your people.

Read that book that you like and that you never find the time to dedicate to it carefully. Or go out and take a walk in the park letting the sun light up your face. Physical exercise is also essential to lead a balanced life. It is an excellent therapy for emotional problems and helps us keep our minds young and thus think more clearly.

Take care of your self-esteem , and do not let another person have your time as if it were worth nothing. Remember that the clock keeps turning and nobody will be able to give you back that time that makes you lose.

Today, technological advances constantly abstract us. So, something that can give you a break is finding 15 minutes at some point in the day to eliminate all those distractions . Turn off the phone, the TV, the computer, everything that can blur your attention and be present here and now. Spend a moment of tranquility with yourself, with friends or with your partner.

Something that undoubtedly brings us to the present is the practice of mindfulness meditation , ideal to carry out in these small moments.

Life is full of details that never get our attention . Perhaps it is also due to the same hedonic adaptation, but the truth is that this does not detract from their beauty.

The smell of wet earth, the wind running through the leaves. Nature has a way of flowing that is older than any discipline , religion and belief we can have. It is older than the origin of life, older than our planet. Much older than us. Watch her.

The beauty of an attitude of solidarity towards another person. Few things are as profitable as giving something to someone who needs it. Finding a way to give without expecting anything in return, even if it is only our time, our company, is to contribute something positive to the world and participate in the beauty of life.

We believe that the present is an ephemeral moment, but the truth is that it is continuous and dynamic . We are the present at every moment, but we can lose ourselves if we do not learn to be here and now.

It is time to change our way of perceiving the present.

It's in your hands.
